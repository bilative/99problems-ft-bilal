#### Distance at n dimention: [code](https://github.com/bilative/99problems-ft-bilal/blob/master/mi-problemas/files/distance_at_n_dim.py)
- "Here is a more troublesome difference: if you pick two points randomly in a unit square, the distance between these two points will be, on average, roughly 0.52. If you pick two random points in a unit 3D cube, the average distance will be roughly 0.66. But what about two points picked randomly in a 1,000,000-dimensional hypercube? Well, the average distance, believe it or not, will be about 408.25 (roughly 1, 000, 000/6)!"

* After i read this chapter I think that i should check it.

#### Fang Dice Problem: [code](https://github.com/bilative/99problems-ft-bilal/blob/master/mi-problemas/files/faang_dice_problem.py)
* Amy and Brad take turns in rolling a fair six-sided die. Whoever rolls a “6” first wins the game. Amy starts by rolling first. What’s the probability that Amy wins?

#### My web page version of Github-heatmap: [code](https://github.com/bilative/99problems-ft-bilal/blob/master/mi-problemas/files/files/github_heatmap.md)
* I'll host my own personal website soon. And I'm on [x-days-of-code](https://bilative.github.io/xdaysofcode) challange. I decided to build activity heatmap (like github commit heatmap) and I searched little bit. And found the way that I can create it, but the problem was automizing.

#### Clock angle problem: [code (python)](https://github.com/bilative/99problems-ft-bilal/blob/master/mi-problemas/files/files/clock_angle.ipynb) - [code (javascript)](https://github.com/bilative/99problems-ft-bilal/blob/master/mi-problemas/files/files/clock_angle.js)
* Problem is: What is the angle between hour and minute hand?

#### Birthday Paradox [code (python)](https://github.com/bilative/99problems-ft-bilal/blob/main/mi-problemas/files/birthday_problem.ipynb)
- In probability theory, the birthday problem asks for the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, at least two will share a birthday. The birthday paradox is that, counterintuitively, the probability of a shared birthday exceeds 50% in a group of only 23 people.
