## DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS (WITH C)
* I'm doing a master degree in computer science. I'm in my scientific preparation year (because I'm not a computer engineer or a computer science graduate). And this semester I am taking data structures and algorithms course.
* I decided to share the answers of the homeworks I took within the scope of this course.
* I think all of my homework solutions'll be written in c. (We'll see :d)
